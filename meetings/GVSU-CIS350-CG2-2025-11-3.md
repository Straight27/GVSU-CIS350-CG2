Team name: The Computer Guys 2

Members present: Ryan, Enrique, Ian, Jayden

Date: 11/3/2025

Time: 1:50 - 2:50

Discussion points:

* Jayden went over what he had done over the weekend, largely using AI to develop a working mockup that will allow Ryan to work off of. Doing so showed us that we do not need to use any specific database, as Chrome Web Storage allows us to store data securely through the google account. 
* Enrique and Ian began working on the sprite, with Enrique developing a crude mock-up.
* Jayden and Ryan went through the notification system, with Jayden explaining how it works. The two of them also went together and implemented the ability for the notification to display how many assignments the user has due the same day.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Ryan will rewrite the portion of code that was from AI, ensruign that we fully know what the code does and how it works. 
* Enrique and Ian will work on the sprite and implement it into the extension.
