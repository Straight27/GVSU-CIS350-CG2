Team name: The Computer Guys 2

Members present: Ryan, Enrique, Ian, Jayden

Date: 10/31/2025

Time: 2:00-2:30

Discussion points:

* We are no longer going with React. Instead, we are sticking with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
* Decided that a GIF would be better for the sprite, so we do not have to constantly iterate through different images. 
* Decided that Google Storage API would probably be the best storage for our extension, as it should be easy to implement and can save data without requiring the user to log in.
* Implemented multiple HTML files and figured out how to navigate between them.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Ryan: Learn the pipeline process for inputting data into the storage API
* Enrique: Set back from the shift from React. Test out different styles and decide which we should use (focus on CSS)
* Ian: Design the sprite and create multiple GIFs to represent each of the sprites emotions
* Jayden: Implement the base layout of the extension and assist others where necessary
