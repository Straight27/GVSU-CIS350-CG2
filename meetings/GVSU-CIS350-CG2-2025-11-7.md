Team name: The Computer Guys 2

Members present: Ryan, Enrique, Ian, Jayden

Date: 11/7/2025

Time: 2:00 - 2:50

Discussion points:

* We only have 2 more meetings with Alyshai, we need to make them count.
* Finished by the second-last week of November is ideal and should be strived for.
* Scope of the project was lowered as a result of not needing to log into anything or manage any backend databases. Rather, we need to gamify our project.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Jayden - Support Ryan
* Ryan - Moved from using external database to Chrome. Currently learning how to use Chrome storage API. Next week, try to work on edit assignment functionality.
* Enrique - Made a temp sprite gif to load into the extension. Made some tweaks with how we want the dashboard to look like. Plans to complete the dashboard and move onto the settings / closet for next week.
* Ian - Make sure the sprite works the date, making so it reacts to the homeworks due date. For example, it will be anxious if an assignment is due soon.
