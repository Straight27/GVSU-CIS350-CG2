# Introduction

Our project concept is a sort of tracker that will help the user complete their goals, whether they are related to health or academic. This idea is going to be accomplished through an animated sprite, who will help motivate the user to completing tasks related to their goals by incentivizing continuous work. Once a task is complete, either food or cosmetics will be given to the animated sprite, ensuring that the user has a sense of accomplishment not only within themselves, but in the sprite as well.

This project is inspired by the Tamagotchi, and will promote consistency in vital areas of your life by leveraging the responsibility of your sprite's well-being and growth. As you grow for the better, so does your sprite.

# Anticipated Technologies

We are undecided on exactly which platform we will use, but we have them limited to the following and the coding language they will use:
* IOS App - Swift
* Android App - Kotlin
* Webpage - HTML/JavaScript

# Method/Approach

Our plan for this project is to create a mock-up of the project that we all feel sufficient with, and to make sure that throughout the coding process, this template is kept in mind. When we get closer to having a finished project, ideally we would like to have users test it so that we can get feedback on how we can make it better.

# Estimated Timeline

Currently, we only have plans for next week. They are as follows:
* Determine Roles
* Create a crude mock-up using Figma or related software
* Establish Project Management through Trello or related software

# Anticipated Problems

One problem that we foresee is having to learn a new language to create a mobile application. 

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
