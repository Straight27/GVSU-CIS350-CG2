# Computer Guys II

Team Name: Computer Guys 2

Project Name: TBD

Project Catch-Phrase: TBD

An academic chrome extension that features a small animated sprite. This tamagotchi-inspired extension will leverage the user's ability to stay consistent through their different classes. The more consistent the user is, shown through their completion of assignments, the longer the sprite will live and grow. The sprite is also subject to negative effects if the user's actions are inconsistent. 
The goal for the extension is to promote consistency within the user's academic career. It will allow the user to set a goal for themselves, and any work past the goal will reward the user with cosmetics for their sprite.

## Functional Requirements
* The extension shall track assignments that the user logs.
* The extension shall provide notifications in the upper-right corner of Google to keep the user on task.
* The extension shall provide the user the ability to log into and store data.

## Non-functional Requirements
* The extension shall have an animated sprite to keep the user engaged and create a sense of responsibility.
* The extension shall have an accessibility option for color-blind and visually impaired individuals.
* The extension shall be operable on the latest version of Chrome and accross other search engines.
