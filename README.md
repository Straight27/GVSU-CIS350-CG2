# Computer Guys II

Team Name: Computer Guys 2

Project Name: Study Sprite

Project Catch-Phrase: TBD

An academic chrome extension that features a small animated sprite. This tamagotchi-inspired extension will leverage the user's ability to stay consistent through their different classes. The more consistent the user is, shown through their completion of assignments, the longer the sprite will live and grow. The sprite is also subject to negative effects if the user's actions are inconsistent. 
The goal for the extension is to promote consistency within the user's academic career. It will allow the user to set a goal for themselves, and any work past the goal will reward the user with cosmetics for their sprite.
